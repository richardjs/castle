			<p style="margin-top: 20px"><span class="lead">Ruins of a medieval
			castle with a checkered history rest on the hill outside of
			town.</span> Built by the illustrious duke of the shire, the
			fortress stood as a testament to the goodwill and kindness of her
			benevolent lord. Eventually, the manor was ruled by a man whose
			thirst for power ultimately shattered his life and the estate.</p>

			<p>Rumor states that the last duke left behind a secret map that
			will lead the user to the remnants of his treasure horde in another
			land. Despite evidence indicating that the remnants of the castle
			are dangerous, you have decided to discover the map so that you can
			obtain the fabled riches. Armed only with your trusted Explorerâ€™s
			Sling, excitement awaits you as you seek adventure and wonder
			throughout the world!</p>
